Fri Dec 27,Eric Prydz Presents: HOLO NYC, Expo Center  The Bronx ,New York,ALL TICKETS SOLD OUT!First and Only US HOLO ShowsDecember 27 + 28 + 29 2019 New York Expo CenterVIP Tables: call 934-444-2445 or email vip@degpresents.com For Ticket Holders: Upgrade for OPEN BAR + TABLES below  Friday | Saturday | SundayEric Prydz has been a name on everyone’s lips this summer under his Pryda alias he released an album’s worth of material his new live shows Holosphere and V O I D were the talk of Tomorrowland and Creamfields and his Labor Day performance at Brooklyn Mirage was reportedly the biggest of the year. Prydz continues to push boundaries both in the studio and in the live space and this Winter will debut his acclaimed HOLO show in New York at an incredible cavernous location in the Bronx the 60000 sq foot New York Expo Center. Presented by DEG Presents these will be the first and last US performances of HOLO and will feature greater production levels than any previous Prydz US show.HOLO came to life last year as a series of three concerts in the UK before returning to sell out the 15000 Steel Yard in London this summer in record-time. The unique combination of video combined with Prydz signature and bespoke light and laser set up have made HOLO one of the most admired live shows in electronic music. HOLO is an outgrowth of Prydz’s original EPIC concert series which have centered around a pioneering use of holograms. The Verge called these shows ‘the ambitious future of concert tech’ this summer when the sixth installment of EPIC HOLOSPHERE debuted at Tomorrowland. HOLO NYC is a very different show than HOLOSPHERE which centered Prydz inside a transparent LED physical sphere.HOLO marks the first major large-scale production concert from Prydz in America since he performed EPIC 4.0 in 2016. As with EPIC and other Prydz concert experiences like V O I D the HOLO shows are site-specific and temporal no two are the same and no further HOLO dates are planned at this time. A HOLO NYC pre-sale sign-up will launch immediately today for both shows. The pre-sale will take place on Sept 10th at 10am EST with pre-sale codes sent at 9am Sept 10 and is designed to help fans purchase tickets directly for the show and prevent scalpers moving tickets into the secondary market.

Fri Feb 8,They Might Be Giants Present 30th Anniversary Flood Show,Bowery Ballroom ,New York,"	Tickets on sale Fri 10/04 at 12pm ESTCiti® Cardmember Presale: Tues 10/01 at 10am - Thurs 10/03 at 10pm ESTCode: Use the first six digits of your Citi® card.THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS PRESENT 30th ANNIVERSARY FLOOD SHOWIn honor of the album that made them an international act They Might Be Giants is celebrating Flood's 30th anniversary in 2020 by performing the album in its entirety on stages in select cities across the US. The show is ""an evening with"" and TMBG will play two full sets with their barnstorming live band featuring the show-stopping Curt Ramm on trumpet. How will it be presented? In sequence in reverse sequence alphabetical or mixed into additional repertoire? It could be different on any given night. But in addition to Flood the song selection in the “evening with” show will span the band's entire career from early favorites to brand new tracks as well as the live improvisations that have become a highlight of TMBG shows.ABOUT FLOODBefore Alternative Rock when rock dinosaurs still roamed the earth They Might Be Giants crawled out of the primordial performance art scene of the Lower East Side and on to the college rock scene with a series of breakthrough songs and best-selling albums. Vaulted into the national scene by a series of highly creative videos the band ultimately garnered the attention of the powerhouse major-label Elektra Entertainment. Collaborating with British hit-makers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley as well as emerging indie engineers Roger Moutenot and Patrick Dillett the band embarked on an album that would leave their lo-fi roots behind in exchange for a sonic adventure to be called Flood. Embraced by critics and audiences alike the 19-song album would go on to go platinum and garner a clutch of timeless favorites for the band including ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"" ""Your Racist Friend"" ""Istanbul (Not Constantinople)"" ""Particle Man"" ""Dead"" and many others.SOME MORE GOOD NEWS IN BAD TIMES FROM THEY MIGHT BE GIANTSIn August TMBG offered up a special limited edition benefit t-shirt with 100% of profits going to RAICES a Texas legal team aiding separated families and detained minors seeking asylum in the US. Over the course of a wild month the TMBG fan community raised $60000. In the last days of the fundraiser John Flansburgh accidentally auto-filled an email address meant for a Jeff on the band’s road crew with Jeff Lawson the founder of Twilio who had hosted the band at a company event a few years back. Jeff mentioned he was encouraged by the band’s effort to raise money to end this harrowing episode and he offered to match any funds raised by the band. This in turn led to a whole new wave of interest on social media ultimately bringing the total money raised to $200000. (Yes the band raised $200000 for a very good cause by selling t-shirts!)	"

Sat Dec 7,Lightning Bolt,Pioneer Works ,New York,Lightning Bolt has revolutionized underground rock in immeasurable ways over the course of its two-decade existence. The duo drummer Brian Chippendale and bassist Brian Gibson broke the barrier between stage and audience by setting themselves up on the floor in the midst of the crowd. Their momentous live performances and the mania they inspired paved the way for similar tactics used by Dan Deacon and literally hundreds of others. Similarly the band's recordings have always been chaotic roaring blown out documents that sound like they could destroy even the toughest set of speakers. Sonic Citadel Lightning Bolt's seventh album is not to be missed. USAISAMONSTER a prog rock band formed in Virginia but based in New York played all over the world and released 8 LPs between 2000 – 2009. Their lyrics dealt with Native American history current politics and abstract poetry. In 2009 the band broke up but were rebirthed as founders Tom Hohmann and Colin Langenus began working on new material in residency at Pioneer Works.Formed in 2004 Animental is a female experimental performance group that creates animal-themed noise theater.  Core members Barbara Hohmann and Sara Shapouri are returning to the stage as an eel and sea slug.Baby; Baby: Explores the Reasons Why that Gum is Still on the Sidewalk is a hand-wave parody of sound pseudo-concept garage future punk project made up of three strange birds from the to-be-ghost town/clam chowder suburbia of Warwick RI. Utilizing found and recycled gear the band makes simple structured danceable songs that pay homage to musique concrète European underground synth punk of the late 70’s anthem music dada and the Providence DIY & noise scene.

Sat Dec 14,OM and Emel Mathlouthi,Pioneer Works ,New York,"	There remains the singularity of purpose that is the core of all OM records but no single reason can account for this comprehensive nature of their evolution. On their newest album the core primary sound of OM remains yet everything reaches further and becomes more of itself. Whatever drone-doom camp that OM had previously been placed in has been decimated by the sheer imagination and expansive quality of this recording. For a band that has continually followed its own course and stood alone in its sound and approach ADVAITIC SONGS for certain is the band’s most focused progressive document. Emel Mathlouthi rose to prominence after her 2007 recording ""Kelmti Horra (My Word Is Free)"" became a viral anthem during the Arab Spring earning her the title ""voice of the Tunisian revolution"" and eventually an invitation to perform at the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. Her powerful heartfelt music defies genres melding together electronica Tunisian textures and a cinematic universe. 	"

Sat Mar 9,Glennon Doyle: Untamed at St. Ann's Church,St. Ann & the Holy Trinity Church ,New York,In her most personal and inspiring book yet the beloved speaker philanthropist activist and author explores the wild joy we discover when we stop trying to be good for others and start living true to ourselves.This is how you find yourself.There is a voice of longing inside every woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good mothers daughters partners employees citizens and friends. We believe all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead it leaves us feeling weary stuck overwhelmed and underwhelmed. We look at our lives relationships and world and wonder: Wasn’t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question telling ourselves to be grateful. We hide our simmering discontent—even from ourselves. Until we reach our boiling point.Four years ago Glennon Doyle—bestselling Oprah-endorsed author renowned activist and humanitarian wife and mother of three—was speaking at a conference when a woman entered the room. Glennon looked at her and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. Soon she realized that they came to her from within.Glennon was finally hearing her own voice—the voice that had been silenced by decades of cultural conditioning numbing addictions and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl Glennon had been before the world told her who to be. She vowed to never again abandon herself. She decided to build a life of her own—one based on her individual desire intuition and imagination. She would reclaim her true untamed self.Soulful and uproarious forceful and tender Untamed is both a memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It offers a piercing electrifying examination of the restrictive expectations women are issued from birth; shows how hustling to meet those expectations leaves women feeling dissatisfied and lost; and reveals that when we quit abandoning ourselves and instead abandon the world’s expectations of us we become women who can finally look at our lives and recognize: There She Is.Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are the luckier we get.Glennon Doyle is the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Love Warrior an Oprah’s Book Club selection as well as the New York Times bestseller Carry On Warrior. An activist speaker and thought leader she is also the founder and president of Together Rising an all-women led nonprofit organization that has revolutionized grassroots philanthropy—raising over $22 million for women families and children in crisis with a most frequent donation of just $25. Glennon was named among OWN Network’s SuperSoul100 inaugural group as one of 100 “awakened leaders who are using their voices and talent to elevate humanity.” She lives in Florida with her wife and three children.This event will be held at St. Ann's Church at 157 Montague St. in Brooklyn Heights. All tickets are seated and every ticket includes 1 copy of Untamed.  Doors open at 6:15pm.

Sat Mar 9,Glennon Doyle: Untamed at St. Ann's Church,St. Ann & the Holy Trinity Church ,New York,In her most personal and inspiring book yet the beloved speaker philanthropist activist and author explores the wild joy we discover when we stop trying to be good for others and start living true to ourselves.This is how you find yourself.There is a voice of longing inside every woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good mothers daughters partners employees citizens and friends. We believe all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead it leaves us feeling weary stuck overwhelmed and underwhelmed. We look at our lives relationships and world and wonder: Wasn’t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question telling ourselves to be grateful. We hide our simmering discontent—even from ourselves. Until we reach our boiling point.Four years ago Glennon Doyle—bestselling Oprah-endorsed author renowned activist and humanitarian wife and mother of three—was speaking at a conference when a woman entered the room. Glennon looked at her and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. Soon she realized that they came to her from within.Glennon was finally hearing her own voice—the voice that had been silenced by decades of cultural conditioning numbing addictions and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl Glennon had been before the world told her who to be. She vowed to never again abandon herself. She decided to build a life of her own—one based on her individual desire intuition and imagination. She would reclaim her true untamed self.Soulful and uproarious forceful and tender Untamed is both a memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It offers a piercing electrifying examination of the restrictive expectations women are issued from birth; shows how hustling to meet those expectations leaves women feeling dissatisfied and lost; and reveals that when we quit abandoning ourselves and instead abandon the world’s expectations of us we become women who can finally look at our lives and recognize: There She Is.Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are the luckier we get.Glennon Doyle is the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Love Warrior an Oprah’s Book Club selection as well as the New York Times bestseller Carry On Warrior. An activist speaker and thought leader she is also the founder and president of Together Rising an all-women led nonprofit organization that has revolutionized grassroots philanthropy—raising over $22 million for women families and children in crisis with a most frequent donation of just $25. Glennon was named among OWN Network’s SuperSoul100 inaugural group as one of 100 “awakened leaders who are using their voices and talent to elevate humanity.” She lives in Florida with her wife and three children.This event will be held at St. Ann's Church at 157 Montague St. in Brooklyn Heights. All tickets are seated and every ticket includes 1 copy of Untamed.  Doors open at 6:15pm.
